    <p>
        In this study, you'll be playing a simple fighting game against an computer-controlled opponent ("CPU"). 
        Over the course of the study, you'll work to hone-in your skills and learn effective strategies. 
        You'll be able to earn a bonus by beating the CPU in the "initial challenge" and "final challenge" rounds.
    <p>
        <b>Here's how the study will progress.</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Before you begin, you'll fill our a brief survey.</li>
            <li>You'll first have an "initial challenge" with a set of 10 rounds against a CPU opponent. This is your first opportunity to earn a bonus. We'll ask a few brief questions once you've completed these rounds.</li>
            <li>Next, you'll practice the game for 45 rounds against a CPU training partner. This is not that same opponent that you will play in the initial or final challenge, but rather a partner that is meant to help you learn the game.<b> The goal here is to become as skilled as possible so that you maximize your bonus in the final rounds.</b> Once completed, you'll again fill out a brief survey.</li>
            <li>Finally, you'll play 10 rounds in our "final challenge" section of the study. This is your final opportunity to earn a bonus. We'll ask a few brief questions once you've completed these rounds.</li>
            <li>Before ending, you'll answer a few final questions about your experience with the game and your CPU opponents.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Your bonus will be based on your performance in the "initial challenge" and "final challenge" rounds</b>. 
        In total, you'll play 20 rounds of the game where you can earn a bonus if you win: <b> each time you 
        win in these rounds, you'll earn $0.20.</b> There will be a survey that provides an opportunity to earn an additional $0.80 bonus. 
        <b>The maximum bonus you can earn is $4.00.</b>
