## v1.11 Requirements

Requirements for v1.11 Data Export Edge Cases milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### isFocused Column Consistency

- [x] **FOCUS-COL-01**: Both players export isFocused.0 and isFocused.1 columns regardless of whether focus loss occurred
- [x] **FOCUS-COL-02**: isFocused columns contain accurate values (true when focused, false when backgrounded)

### Episode Boundary Row Parity

- [x] **BOUND-01**: Both players export exactly the same number of rows (0 row tolerance)
- [x] **BOUND-02**: Fast-forward processing stops at episode boundary, not after
- [x] **BOUND-03**: `_promoteRemainingAtBoundary()` handles backgrounded player correctly

### Dual-Buffer Stress Handling

- [x] **STRESS-01**: `test_active_input_with_latency[100]` passes without xfail marker
- [x] **STRESS-02**: `test_active_input_with_latency[200]` passes without xfail marker
- [x] **STRESS-03**: `test_active_input_with_packet_loss` passes without xfail marker
- [x] **STRESS-04**: `test_focus_loss_mid_episode_parity` passes without xfail marker
- [x] **STRESS-05**: `test_focus_loss_episode_boundary_parity` passes without xfail marker

### Verification

- [x] **VERIFY-01**: All E2E tests pass with no xfail markers remaining
- [x] **VERIFY-02**: Research data exports from both players are byte-identical (ignoring timestamps)
