## Cross-Phase Integration

### Data Flow Connections (18/18 connected)

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|----|----|--------|
| aggregator.py | admin.js | state_update SocketIO | ✓ |
| admin.js | namespace.py | request_state SocketIO | ✓ |
| app.py | aggregator.py | track_session_start() | ✓ |
| app.py | aggregator.py | record_session_completion() | ✓ |
| app.py | aggregator.py | record_session_termination() | ✓ |
| app.py | aggregator.py | receive_p2p_health() | ✓ |
| pyodide_multiplayer_game.js | app.py | p2p_health_report SocketIO | ✓ |
| admin.js | dashboard.html | DOM element IDs (22 total) | ✓ |
| admin.css | dashboard.html | CSS classes | ✓ |

### API/Event Coverage

| Event | Emitter | Handler | Status |
|-------|---------|---------|--------|
| state_update | aggregator.py | admin.js | ✓ |
| p2p_health_report | pyodide_multiplayer_game.js | app.py | ✓ |
| request_state | admin.js | namespace.py | ✓ |

### DOM Element Verification

All 22 DOM elements referenced by `getElementById()` in admin.js exist in dashboard.html:
- Stats: stat-connected, stat-waiting, stat-games, stat-completed, stat-completion, stat-avg-duration
- Containers: participants-container, waiting-rooms-container, multiplayer-games-container, activity-timeline, console-logs-container
- Counts: participant-count, activity-count, games-count, logs-count
- UI: connection-status, problems-indicator, session-detail-overlay, session-detail-content, log-level-filter, log-participant-filter

### CSS Class Coverage

All dynamically-generated CSS classes have style definitions:
- health-{healthy|degraded|reconnecting}
- session-problem
- log-{level}
- player-health-{status}

## End-to-End Flows

### Flow 1: Participant Completion Tracking ✓
```
URL access → track_session_start() → game completion → record_session_completion()
  → aggregator snapshot → state_update → dashboard shows "X of Y (Z%)"
```

### Flow 2: Multiplayer Health Monitoring ✓
```
P2P game starts → _startP2PHealthReporting() → 2s interval reports
  → app.py handler → aggregator cache → session cards with health indicators
```

### Flow 3: Session Detail Panel ✓
```
Click session card → showSessionDetail() → renderSessionDetailContent()
  → panel shows info + errors + termination → close button hides panel
```

### Flow 4: Problems Indicator ✓
```
Console error arrives → updateProblemsIndicator() → badge shows count
  → click badge → scrollToProblems() → scroll + filter to errors
```

**Flow Status:** 4/4 flows complete
