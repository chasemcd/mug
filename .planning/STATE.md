Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- Aggressive cleanup scope: full repo (server, client JS, scenes, examples, tests, docs)
- Zero functionality changes — every refactor verified by tests
- Keep .planning/ directory as project history
- Dead code removal first (3 phases by layer), then naming (2 phases), then structure (1 phase), then final verification

### Pending Todos
