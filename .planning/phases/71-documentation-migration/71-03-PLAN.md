<objective>
Final verification sweep confirming zero references to removed GymScene methods across all documentation.

Purpose: Plans 01 and 02 migrated 15 files independently. This plan runs a comprehensive grep across ALL documentation to catch any references that were missed, including files the research may not have identified. This closes DOCS-01 and DOCS-02 requirements.

Output: Verification results confirming zero remaining references, or fixes applied to any missed references.

  <name>Task 1: Comprehensive verification and fix-up sweep</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run a comprehensive grep across ALL documentation files (docs/, interactive_gym/examples/**/README.md, README.md at root) to verify zero remaining references to removed GymScene methods. Exclude docs/_build/ which is auto-generated.

Search for ALL removed method names:
1. `.pyodide(` -- removed, should be .runtime() or .multiplayer()
2. `.user_experience(` -- removed, should be .content() or .waitroom()
3. `.continuous_monitoring(` -- removed, should be params on .multiplayer()
4. `.exclusion_callbacks(` -- removed, should be params on .multiplayer()
5. `.focus_loss_config(` -- removed, should be params on .multiplayer()
6. `.player_grouping(` -- removed, should be params on .multiplayer()
7. `.reconnection_config(` -- removed, should be params on .multiplayer()
8. `.partner_disconnect_message_config(` -- removed, should be params on .multiplayer()
9. `.player_pairing(` -- removed, should be params on .multiplayer()

Also search for backtick-quoted references without the dot prefix:
- `pyodide()` (in text like "the `.pyodide()` method")
- `user_experience()` (in text)
- `continuous_monitoring()` (in text)
- `exclusion_callbacks()` (in text)

IMPORTANT: The word "pyodide" by itself (referring to the Python-in-browser technology) is NOT a problem. Only `.pyodide()` or `pyodide()` as a GymScene method reference needs to be fixed.

If ANY matches are found:
- Fix them using the same migration rules from Plans 01 and 02
- The 71-RESEARCH.md file has the complete parameter mapping table

If ZERO matches are found:
- Report clean verification

Additionally verify:
- `docs/multiplayer-sync-optimization.html` has been deleted (Plan 02 should have done this)
- No new files with old references have appeared
  </action>
  <verify>
Run all verification commands from research:
```
grep -r --include="*.rst" --include="*.md" \
  -e '\.pyodide(' -e '\.user_experience(' \
  -e '\.continuous_monitoring(' -e '\.exclusion_callbacks(' \
  -e '\.focus_loss_config(' -e '\.player_grouping(' \
  -e '\.reconnection_config(' -e '\.partner_disconnect_message_config(' \
  -e '\.player_pairing(' \
  docs/ interactive_gym/examples/ \
  --exclude-dir=_build
```
Must return zero matches.

```
grep -r --include="*.rst" --include="*.md" \
  -e 'pyodide()' -e 'user_experience()' \
  -e 'continuous_monitoring()' -e 'exclusion_callbacks()' \
  docs/ interactive_gym/examples/ \
  --exclude-dir=_build
```
Must return zero matches.

`test ! -f docs/multiplayer-sync-optimization.html && echo "CLEAN" || echo "STALE HTML EXISTS"` -- must print CLEAN.
  </verify>
  <done>Comprehensive grep across all docs/ and README files returns zero matches for any removed GymScene method name. DOCS-01 and DOCS-02 requirements are satisfied.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Requirements verification:
- DOCS-01: All documentation files in docs/ use new API method names -- confirmed by zero grep matches for any of the 9 removed method names
- DOCS-02: All code examples in documentation are accurate and use new API methods -- confirmed by grep + visual review of code blocks in verification task
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Zero grep matches for any removed GymScene method name across docs/ and examples/
- Zero backtick-quoted references to removed methods in text
- Stale HTML export confirmed deleted
- DOCS-01 and DOCS-02 requirements closeable
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/71-documentation-migration/71-03-SUMMARY.md`
